The purpose of this hands on is to get a first glance at ReactJS and its ecosystem.
Obviously this hands on is made for TDD practitioners :)

# Installation
Clone this repo and then launch "npm install"
That's all folks!

To check that everything works properly you can:
 - launch "npm test". You should see a green message saying that one test is successful
 - launch "webpack-dev-server" and open in your browser URL http://localhost:8080
